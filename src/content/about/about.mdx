My name is <b>Alice Kim</b>, and I am a 5th year student at UBC majoring in Computer Science.

I've decided to major in CS because I love to be challenged, and I really liked the fact that I can take the ownership of the projects I work on.

Right now, I'm working as an external developer at <Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.nwPlus}>nwPlus</Underlining>.
