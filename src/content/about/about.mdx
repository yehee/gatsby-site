My name is <b>Alice Kim</b>, and I am a 5th year student at UBC majoring in Computer Science.

I decided to major in CS because I love to be challenged, and the projects I get to work on could impact millions of people around the globe.

Right now, I'm working as an intern at <Underlining color={Theme.colors.secondary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>Google</Underlining>.
